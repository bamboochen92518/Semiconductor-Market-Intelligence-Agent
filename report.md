# Case Brief: AI Agent for Real-Time Semiconductor Market Intelligence

## Problem Definition

The semiconductor industry is one of the most data-intensive and volatile sectors in the global economy. Analysts and investors must continuously track large amounts of information — including financial reports, market caps, efficiency metrics, policy shifts, and supply chain news — across multiple regions and languages.

However, this process is **manual, fragmented, and time-consuming**:

- **Information overload:** Thousands of semiconductor-related news items and reports are released daily from global sources (U.S., Taiwan, Korea, Japan, China).
- **Delayed reactions:** Market-impacting events often occur during off-hours due to time zone differences.
- **High cognitive cost:** Analysts spend hours filtering irrelevant content or verifying misinformation.
- **Human inconsistency:** Judgment on what is "relevant" or "market-moving" varies between analysts.

As a result, financial and strategic decisions are frequently based on **outdated, incomplete, or biased information** — leading to missed opportunities or suboptimal investments.

Quantitatively, a typical analyst may spend **4–6 hours daily** collecting and sorting information before even beginning analysis. Across a team of 10 analysts, this equates to **10,000+ labor hours per year** lost to repetitive filtering.

## Technical Implementation Overview

Our solution leverages three core technologies integrated into a unified autonomous agent:

**1. SingularityNET MeTTa Knowledge Graph**
- **Hypergraph Structure:** Stores semiconductor industry relationships as symbolic atoms using MeTTa's type-safe expression system
- **Knowledge Base:** Contains 15+ major semiconductor companies with detailed financial metrics, market positioning, and risk factors
- **Symbolic Reasoning:** Enables complex pattern matching queries like `(company ?x (segment "AI chips") (recommendation "buy"))` for investment analysis
- **Runtime Learning:** Supports dynamic knowledge addition and relationship inference

**2. Fetch.ai uAgents Framework**
- **Autonomous Operation:** Runs as an independent agent on the Fetch.ai network with persistent state management
- **Chat Protocol:** ASI-compatible communication interface supporting natural language interactions through Agentverse
- **Mailbox Integration:** Enables reliable message delivery and response handling for continuous operation
- **Multi-threading:** Parallel processing of news aggregation, stock data retrieval, and knowledge graph queries

**3. Multi-Source Data Integration**
- **NewsAPI:** Premium news service providing structured access to 80,000+ sources with advanced filtering
- **Google News RSS:** Real-time RSS feeds with native time-based filtering (1h, 1d, 7d, 30d formats)
- **Yahoo Finance API:** Live stock data via yfinance library for real-time pricing and market metrics
- **LLM Intelligence:** ASI:One integration for natural language processing, intent classification, and response synthesis

## Expected Outcome

A successful AI-based system should enable **real-time, continuous, and unbiased analysis** of the semiconductor industry by automatically:

1. **Collecting** verified, up-to-date news and data across multiple languages and time zones.
2. **Classifying** each piece of information as *system-level* (policy, materials, global supply chain) or *company-level* (earnings, innovation, leadership).
3. **Extracting and summarizing** relevant metrics such as revenue growth, market capitalization, and efficiency ratios.
4. **Providing investment recommendations** (buy / hold / sell) with transparent reasoning.
5. **Operating autonomously**, updating 24/7 and notifying users of major developments instantly.

**Expected impact:**

- Reduce analyst information-gathering time by **80–90%**.
- Improve **decision accuracy** by integrating diverse data sources.
- Eliminate **time-zone delays**, offering continuous global coverage.
- Build the foundation for **AI-agent–driven enterprise workflows** (F6), where agents evolve from assistants to collaborators and autonomous executors.

## Solution Proposal (Chat-Based)

### Workflow:

1. An analyst manually searches for semiconductor-related articles or company reports.
2. The article text is copied and pasted into a chat-based LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. The LLM summarizes key points and classifies whether the news impacts the industry or a specific company.
4. The analyst manually records results in a spreadsheet and occasionally asks the LLM for financial interpretations or trend summaries.
5. Steps 1–4 are repeated for every article or company.

### Observed Limitations:

1. **Manual repetition:** Copying and pasting articles into the chat is slow and unscalable.
2. **Context loss:** The model forgets prior company data or previously analyzed reports.
3. **Lack of real-time processing:** Requires human input each time — cannot autonomously track new updates.
4. **No integration with financial metrics:** The LLM cannot directly access or correlate live data (revenue, market cap) with textual sentiment.

Overall, the chat-based approach can assist individual analysis but **fails to automate continuous monitoring or decision-making**.

## Solution Proposal (Agentic)

To overcome these limitations, we propose a **multi-module AI Agent System** designed to autonomously monitor, analyze, and interpret semiconductor market data in real time.

### Agentic Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion Module**

   - **Multi-threaded News Aggregation:** Simultaneously fetches from NewsAPI (10 articles/query), Google News RSS (unlimited), and Yahoo Finance RSS (3 relevant articles)
   - **Intelligent Query Generation:** LLM automatically generates 2-3 optimized search queries from natural language input (e.g., "NVIDIA AI chips", "NVIDIA earnings Q3", "GPU market analysis")
   - **Time-Flexible Processing:** Converts human time expressions ("last week", "past month") to API-specific formats (NewsAPI: days, Google News: "7d", "30d")
   - **Duplicate Detection:** Uses 70% title similarity threshold with word overlap analysis to eliminate redundant articles
   - **Source Attribution:** Maintains complete provenance tracking for all data sources with timestamp verification

2. **Classification & Contextualization Module**
